# Bioinformatics fundamentals in Rust

It's a repo to depict essentials algorithms used in bioinformatics that I've coded in Rust mainly for educational purpose.

## Who is this for?

There are plenty of good softwares, pipelines and books in bioinformatics out there but as I've been learning Rust recently I though why don't I improve my bioinformatics skills together with rust learning.. therefore this repo is to host essential/building block algorithms in bioinformatics written in rust.

## Index of algorithms

| Algorithm         | Cargo name in TOML | Description                         | Reference |
|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------|
| Needleman- Wunsch | globalalignment    | Classical pairwise global-alignment |           |
| Smith-Waterman    |                    |                                     |           |
